### The creator of yarnafont, a widely used and loved font

Currently doing random shit that you can't see.
I am learning C/C++, python, lisp/scheme, bash and anything else that feels fun,
but mainly interested in electronics specifically logic-design and it's real world applications.
If you have any questions about my public repos you can ask me on discord (.Yarnamite#0531).
